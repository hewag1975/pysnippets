A good reference in my opinion is the book [Python packages](https://py-pkgs.org/welcome) by Tomas Beuzen and Tiffany Timers. [Chapter 3: How to package a Python](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#package-structure) is basically the approach that is described below.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A root directory with the `<package>` name \n",
    "* A subdirectory `src/<package>` (same name!) containing the Python modules, i.e. files with the extension `.py` containing Python functions\n",
    "* A subdirectory `tests` containing Python files with unit tests\n",
    "* A subdirectory `docs` with additional documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The root directory contains a number of important files to build and install the package as well as to document updates and usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pyproject.toml` contains technical instructions for the computer on how to build and install the package\n",
    "* `README.md` contains instructions for the user on how to install and use the package (detailed documentation can be in `docs`)\n",
    "* `CHANGELOG.md` contains short descriptions on changes, bug fixes, etc. in new versions\n",
    "* `LICENSE`, `CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc. contain further information on contributions, license, etc."
